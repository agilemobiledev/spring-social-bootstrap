# HAR DTO

**HAR DTO** provides POJOs to represent an archival format for HTTP request/response exchanges called [HTTP Archive (HAR)](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/). 

This project also provides compatibility with [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/)'s [API Log Format (ALF)](https://github.com/Mashape/api-log-format), which is based on HAR and is designed for non-browser-based HTTP request/response exchange logging.
