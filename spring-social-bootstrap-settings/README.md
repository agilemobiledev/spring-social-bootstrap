# Spring Social Bootstrap Settings

**Spring Social Bootstrap Settings** defines the `ClientSettings` interface, which specifies the recommended configuration required for a [Spring Social Bootstrap](https://github.com/robinhowlett/spring-social-bootstrap)-based client connecting to a provider API.

The interfaces `ClientPlatformSettings` and `ClientSecuritySettings` define the base API URI and the authentication and/or authorization requirements (if any) respectively to connect to a target API.
